# My Cybersecurity Journey

How it all started!

The journey for me started on a normal day at work as a telecommunication field engineer. I, at the time, was on a repair task at a client's house. His copper broadband was suffering a internal loop fault which I repaired in about 25 minutes. I then happened to stumble across BSc and MSc Certificates on the wall and asked what he did for a living. He then replied with him being a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant at a Faang company (which i will not mention). This is the moment I questioned my career path and life and proceeded to ask him how and where I would be able to start. I could immediately see his eyes glow up and he proceeded to ask for my email and that was it.

Around twenty persistent days passed and to my surprise, I received an email from him thanking me for fixing the repeated broadband issue and a massive advice path narrowing everything from who to follow and where to begin. This brilliant email started my career path in cybersecurity. Oh, certifications later. Learn first.

## INE

I started my journey on the PTS course, which was free at the time. The course provided me with network fundamentals knowledge and, more importantly, penetration testing prerequisites, followed by preliminary skills, programming and the pentest basic. I was on a role! The course, for the most part, prepares you for the eJPT certificate.

A few months into the program, I decided to go for the Google IT Professional Certification just to brush up on my network fundamentals skills. After achieving this, I took a short break from everything. Around March 2022, I made a decision to go for 4 certificates; CCNA, Sec+, eJPT and CEH. 

## CCNA

My journey with CCNA started with attending a class room based crash course for 5 days straight from 9am-6pm. During the course, every module was covered thoroughly from subnetting, how to convert ip to binary and finally, after mid-day, we would be taught how to use packet tracer for labs. My main motivation was that I did not want to fail the CCNA because I really wanted to get networking out of the way to start my preparation for eJPT or Sec+. So, for about 4/5 months, I studied the labs and mocks and passed the exam around the end of August 2022.

## eJPT

The eJPT really stood out to me, not just as a beginner level certificate, but as a hands-on practical pentest certification. INE provides a free PTS course for preparation for the eJPT exam. I studied for the eJPT partially from INE and mostly from TryHackMe, I spent the majority of my time completing the paths provided in a particular sequence being; Intro to CC, complete beginner, pre security, web fundamentals, jr penetration tester and cyber defense.
